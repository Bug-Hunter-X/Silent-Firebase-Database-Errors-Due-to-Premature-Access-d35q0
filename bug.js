The Firebase SDK may throw an error if you try to access a database reference before it's fully initialized.  This can happen if you try to perform a database operation in your app's `onCreate()` or `viewDidLoad()` methods before the Firebase app itself is ready. This often results in silent failures, making it difficult to debug.  Here's an example of problematic code:

```javascript
// Problematic Code
firebase.database().ref('/users').once('value').then(function(snapshot) {
  // ... process snapshot ...
});
```
This might fail if the Firebase app isn't initialized yet.
