# Silent Firebase Database Errors

This repository demonstrates a common, yet silent, error in Firebase applications: attempting database operations before the Firebase app is fully initialized. This often leads to unexpected behavior without clear error messages.

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` file showcases code that attempts to access a Firebase database reference before Firebase is ready.  This results in the database operation failing silently, making it hard to debug.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct approach. It uses `onAuthStateChanged` or `initializeApp`'s promise to ensure the Firebase app is initialized before accessing the database.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the Firebase setup instructions to properly configure your Firebase project.
3. Run `bug.js` to see the silent failure.
4. Run `bugSolution.js` to see the correct implementation.
